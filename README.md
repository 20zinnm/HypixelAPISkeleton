# HypixelAPISkeleton
A skeleton of the new API so we get an idea of what it's going to be like.

I started this project when I heard of how the new Hypixel API is going to work. It's a fully RESTful API based on the specifications described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zYpawtEA5bEbaIBEPaL1Ybt2HjU3es4LPwaD8Jtx4Jw). It's still rough, and keep in mind it's just a skeleton. This is nowhere near what the real one will be and is really just so I can get a feel for how it's going to work. While it's based on the specifications, parts have been adapted to how I thought it might work. It uses a MONGODB databased hosted by me for development (and yes--you can use it too!). Feel free to commit, etc.
